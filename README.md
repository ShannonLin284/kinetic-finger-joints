This repository documents a semester-long research project exploring robotic fabrication of kinetic finger joints for modular timber systems. It includes background research, digital models, robotic toolpaths, fabrication iterations, and final prototypes. The work investigates how traditional finger joints can be reimagined as controlled, rotating connections using multi-axis robotic milling.
